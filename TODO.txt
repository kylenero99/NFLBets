- Predict over/under! Could be just as valuable as spread!
- Make a more complex model: run/pass defense/offense breakdowns, more intricate statistics, etc.
  - Do some research into statistics that are good football game predictions
- Switch to object oriented approach. Create instances of team, game, etc.
- Scale prediction based on distribution of games thus far this year. This allows for adjusting to yearly changes in the game such as rule changes.
- Try an SGD regressor instead of a linear regressor and try different loss functions.
