- Make a more complex model: run/pass defense/offense breakdowns, more intricate statistics, etc.
  - Do some research into statistics that are good football game predictions
  - Implement RBSDM
  
- Feature engineering: Points for average, points for std, points against average, points against std, pd avg, pd std, etc.
- Scale prediction based on distribution of games thus far this year. This allows for adjusting to yearly changes in the game such as rule changes.
- Try an SGD regressor instead of a linear regressor and try different loss functions.
- Try a random forest classifier.

- Implement cookie cutter approach- one run file and all .py files
- Implement automatic execution of file each Tuesday night
